# COVID19gr - Open Data aggregation repository for COVID-19 in Greece. 

Open Data aggregation repository for the evolution of the SARS-COV-2 pandemic in Greece. The repository is being updated as the pandemic evolves.

## 1. Repository structure.

In this repository you will find:

### 1.1. Datasets

Available in machine readable format and frequently updated:
- [23 in .CSV format](https://github.com/akritiko/covid19gr/tree/master/data/csv)
- [23 in .JSON format](https://github.com/akritiko/covid19gr/tree/master/data/json)

**NOTE:** The aforementioned datasets were created and are being maintained mainly by wither *** fellow citizens' initiatives *** who publish them under open data licenses and, of course, gratis free, or by organizations (research centres, private companies, etc.). Following you will find a detailed analysis of the data sources.

### 1.2. Reports (archived)

_(reports in .pdf format are not available since 12/17/2020 due to size brevity reasons for this repository. Instead you can find them as datasets here: [1](https://github.com/akritiko/covid19gr/blob/master/data/csv/eody_daily.csv), [2](https://github.com/akritiko/covid19gr/blob/master/data/csv/govgr_paratiritirio.csv), [3](https://github.com/akritiko/covid19gr/blob/master/data/csv/nta_covid19.csv).)_

Greek Government's reports as they are published through the official websites of COVID19.gov.gr, the National Organization of Public Health (EODY), the National Transparency Agency, etc. The reason behind recording those reports is for the intended audience to be able to cross check the extracted data for validity reasons.

**NOTE:** Many of the available datasets are product of the combination of various sources of raw data. For the best possible validation please refer to the data sources catalogue that will follow, to get informed on how each dataset was created. 

### 1.3. Analysis

[Data Analysis](https://github.com/akritiko/covid19gr/tree/master/analysis): After aggregating the data analysing them is the next logical step. Here you will find a series of attempts to extract valuable knowledge from data analysis. 

### 1.4. Open Data Framework / Policy (Greece)

**Notes on the dataset:**
1. Notes: Moving averages are 7-day backward. The number is based on the daily value. It is assumed to be the same as the previous day if not updated. On the days with no continuity from the previous day due to change of standards, "New" number is treated as 0 and the bar color is changed. Data may be corrected by the developer when it is considered as an obvious misstatement, such as minus value of Tested Positive.
2. Resources: [EODY](https://eody.gov.gr/epidimiologika-statistika-dedomena/ektheseis-covid-19/).

**Notes on the dataset**
1. \*Mobility data by Google are irregularly published (every other day on average). Yet it is the only dataset which provides separate metrics for specific activities (retail, parks, workplaces, etc.). Google's reports will be available for use in order to help addressing the pandemic for as long as they are considered helpful by the health professionals and / or policy makers. They are not published under an open data license but they are publicly available during the pandemic.
2. Apple's data are nationwide and we are aggregating them from the Github repository COVID19_mobility by ActiveConclusion. It is published under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Sandbird/covid19-gr/blob/main/LICENSE) license.
3. TomTom data are about the cities Athens and Thessaloniki and we are aggregating them from the Github repository COVID19_mobility by ActiveConclusion. It is published under the [MIT license](https://github.com/Sandbird/covid19-gr/blob/main/LICENSE) license.
